          I remember being nervous in the Uber on the way to pick you up, but as
          soon as you got in the car I remembered you like it was yesterday...

          Those Pina Coladas were strong hey.

          Then we got lucky and scored some Jim Jeffries tickets. We hopped into
          my brother's Polo and booked it to Pretoria.

          One day you weren't feeling lekker, so we went to Joon's Art Bar in
          Linden.

          And the next week we cooked together and drank some of the wost
          Moringa I've ever had. üòÇ <br /><br />
          The salad was fire though. üßØ

          Our late afternoon walks at Emmerentia were magical. I even got back
          into tree climbing, something I haven't done since I was little.

          After a long day at the Oriental Plaza we went to Ahkalz, a place I've
          wanted to visit for years. <br /><br />
          My stomach is cramping up just writing this. üò∑

          was some) you joined me on a trip to Boven.

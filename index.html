      <h3>
        I put something together to show you some appreciation that I feel I was
        lacking when you were here.
        <br /><br />
        The time we spent together meant a lot to me - even with the bad moments
        we shared. 📷🖼
        <br /><br />
        Though it's up to you to decide how you feel about this, I believe in
        you and your endeavours.
        <hr />
        Steer steadfast into the night sky and howl at the full moon. 🐺🌕
